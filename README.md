# Build-From-Scratch---Season-I_OldGuard
OldGuard is a blockchain node built without libraries. It implements the SHA-256 Sigma compression functions manually via bitwise operators and handles HTTP traffic through raw TCP sockets. Includes a custom Proof-of-Work algorithm and a reputation logic system that autonomously bans malicious actors.
